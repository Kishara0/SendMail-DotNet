  <h1>MailSend_DotNETCore8WebAPI</h1>

  <p>This is a .NET Core 8 Web API project designed to send emails with attachments using MailKit and MimeKit libraries. It offers flexibility and ease of use for developers seeking a robust email sending solution.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Send Emails with Subject and Body:</strong> Construct email messages with clear subject lines and informative content, including support for HTML formatting in the body.</li>
    <li><strong>Attach Multiple Files:</strong> Seamlessly attach multiple files to your emails, ensuring efficient communication with relevant attachments.</li>
    <li><strong>Configurable SMTP Settings:</strong> Tailor the email sending process to your specific needs by configuring SMTP server details like email address, password, host, and port in the `appsettings.json` file.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How This Works</h2>
  <p>The project is composed of several key components:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>SendMailController.cs:</strong> Handles HTTP POST requests to the `/SendMail` endpoint, receiving email details (recipient address, subject, body) and attachment information through a `multipart/form-data` request.</li>
    <li><strong>MailSendService.cs:</strong> Constructs the email message using MimeKit libraries. If attachments are provided, it securely attaches them to the message. Finally, it leverages MailKit's SMTP client to send the email.</li>
    <li><strong>appsettings.json:</strong> Stores crucial SMTP server settings, including email address, password, host, and port. Ensure these details are accurate for successful email delivery.</li>
    <li><strong>Program.cs:</strong> The entry point for the application, where essential services and middleware are configured to enable smooth operation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>API Endpoint</h2>

  <h3>Send Email</h3>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Endpoint:</strong> `POST /SendMail`</li>
    <li><strong>Description:</strong> Sends an email with the specified details and attachments.</li>
    <li><strong>Request:</strong></li>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Content-Type:</strong> `multipart/form-data`</li>
        <li><strong>Body:</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li>`ToEmail`: The email address of the recipient (required)</li>
            <li>`Subject`: The subject line of the email (required)</li>
            <li>`Body`: The body content of the email (required, supports HTML)</li>
            <li>`Attachments`: A list of files to be attached to the email (optional)</li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
    <li><strong>Swagger Interface:</strong> The project likely utilizes Swagger for API documentation, providing a user-friendly interface to explore the `POST /SendMail` endpoint and its parameters.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Additional Considerations</h2>

  <p>Consider these aspects to enhance your project's robustness:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Implement mechanisms to gracefully manage potential issues during email sending.</li>
    <li><strong>Security:</strong> Prioritize security by following best practices for handling sensitive information like email credentials.</li>
    <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Ensure functionality through comprehensive unit and integration tests.</li>
    <li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Provide clear comments within the codebase and additional documentation (wiki, markdown files) to explain setup, usage, and best practices.</
